> NOTE: Elementary OS and Linux Mint are also supported on releases based on Ubuntu 'Trusty' or Ubuntu 'Xenial'.

This script installs the
[latest](https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/releases/latest)
release and all the dependencies, including [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi), [soundcloud](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python), [pafy](https://github.com/mps-youtube/pafy), and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

```bash

    $ curl -kL https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/raw/master/tools/install.sh | bash
    # Or its shortened version:
    $ curl -kL https://goo.gl/Vu8qGR | bash

```

> NOTE: The usual disclaimers apply: trust no-one. Have a look at the installation script before running it in your system.

## Configuration

To use *Spotify*, *Google Play Music*, *SoundCloud* and *Dirble*, introduce
your credentials in Tizonia's config file (see instructions inside the file for
more information):

```bash

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/tizonia
    $ cp /etc/tizonia/tizonia.conf/tizonia.conf $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf

    ( now edit $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf )

```

## Upgrade

To upgrade Tizonia, run 'apt-get' as usual, but also make sure the Python dependencies are up-to-date.

```bash

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

    # (Note that new versions of some of these Python packages are released frequently)
    $ sudo -H pip install --upgrade youtube-dl pafy gmusicapi soundcloud

```

### IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to v0.6.0 from a previous release

If you are upgrading to v0.6.0, please note that plugins are now being
installed in a different directory, ${libdir}/tizonia0-plugins12; that means,
you will need to update your existing *tizonia.conf*, or else *tizonia* will
not work.  Just add 'tizonia0-plugins12' to the 'component-paths' configuration
variable in *tizonia.conf*.

i.e. before 0.6.0:

```
    component-paths = /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf;
```


after 0.6.0:

```
    component-paths = /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/tizonia0-plugins12;
```

  parsers, sinks, etc, for audio/video/other).
  * Full support for OpenMAX IL 1.2 Base and Interop profiles.
2. 'libtizcore' : OpenMAX IL 1.2 Core implementation
  * A C library for discovery and dynamic loading of OpenMAX IL 1.2 plugins.
  * Support for all of the OMX IL 1.2 standard Core APIs, including *OMX_SetupTunnel* and *OMX_TeardownTunnel*.
3. 'libtizplatform' : OS abstraction/utility library
  * A C library with wrappers and utilities for:
    * memory allocation,
    * threading and synchronization primitives,
    * evented I/O (via libev)
    * FIFO and priority queues,
    * dynamic arrays,
    * associative arrays,
    * small object allocation,
    * config file parsing,
    * HTTP parser,
    * uuids,
    * etc..
4. OpenMAX IL 1.2 Resource Management (RM) framework

  * 'libtizrmproxy' : a C client library to interface with the RM daemon.
5. OpenMAX IL 1.2 codecs/plugins
  * Spotify streaming service client ([libspotify](https://github.com/mopidy/libspotify-deb)),
  * Google Play Music streaming service client (based on [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi))
  * YouTube audio streaming service client (based on [pafy](https://github.com/mps-youtube/pafy))
  * SoundCloud streaming service client (based on [soundcloud-python](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python))
  * Dirble internet radio station directory (Dirble REST API + libcurl)
  * mp3 decoders (libmad and libmpg123),
  * mpeg audio (mp2) decoder (libmpg123),
  * Sampled sound formats decoder (various pcm formats, including wav, etc, based on libsndfile)
  * AAC decoder (libfaad),
  * OPUS decoders (libopus and libopusfile)
  * FLAC decoder (libflac)
  * VORBIS decoder (libfishsound)
  * PCM renderers (ALSA and Pulseaudio)
  * OGG demuxer (liboggz)
  * WEBM demuxer (libnestegg)
  * HTTP renderer (i.e. ala icecast, for LAN streaming)
  * HTTP source (libcurl)

## Skema: Tizonia's Python test execution framework
  * Test execution framework to build and test arbitrary OpenMAX IL graphs (tunneled and
    non-tunneled) using a custom, [easy-to-write XML syntax](http://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki/Mp3Playback101).
